Fort Boyard Project
General Overview

Project Description:
The objective of this project was to create a Python-based game inspired by the French TV show Fort Boyard. The game recreates various challenges from the show, including mathematical puzzles and Père Fouras’s riddles, using custom Python functions.

Key Features
Multiple Chances for Players: A supplementary multiple-choice quiz gives players a second chance to succeed in the game.
Team Creation: Players can form teams to tackle challenges together.
Learning Opportunity: The project integrates multiple programming concepts and languages, enhancing coding skills.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, JSON
Libraries/Frameworks: React, NumPy
Fort Boyard Project Repository

 

Game Algorithm
The game operates using the following structure:

Main Function:
Launches all functions.
Tracks the number of keys collected.
Determines if the game ends in a win or loss.
Facilitates team creation and challenge selection.

Challenge Functions:
Math Function: Randomly selects and executes a mathematical challenge.
Logical Challenge: Randomly selects and executes a logical puzzle.
Chance Challenge: Randomly selects and executes a chance-based activity.
Père Fouras Challenge: Presents a riddle for the player to solve.
Input and Error Management
Error Handling:
Managed unexpected results through debugging tools in PyCharm.

Known Bugs:
Initial issues with the key count functionality (now resolved).
Project Timeline
November: Task distribution among contributors.
December: Development and implementation of individual functions.
January: Finalization of functions, integration of all components, and documentation (README.md).

Task Distribution
Hugo: Père Fouras challenges, utility functions, documentation (README).
Youssef: Mathematical challenges, logical challenges, and the final game challenge.
Both: Main function and chance-based challenges.
Testing and Validation
Testing Strategies:

Comprehensive testing of all program components to identify and resolve issues.
Verification of JSON file integration to ensure smooth functionality.
